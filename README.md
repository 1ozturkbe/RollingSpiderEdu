# RollingSpiderEdu
Rolling Spider software package for Education

/Parrot_customFirmware/ contains files and a quick start manual for Parrot's custom firmware that opens up interfaces to implement custom estimation and control algorithms.

/MIT_MatlabToolbox/ contains MIT's Rolling Spider Matlab Toolbox ROSMAT that builds around Parrot's custom firmware and let's you design and simulate estimation and control algorithms for the Rolling Spider in MATLAB/Simulink and autogenerates embedded c-code that you can use to actually fly the drone. Please refer to MIT_MatlabToolbox/README.txt
